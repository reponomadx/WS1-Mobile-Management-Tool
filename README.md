The Workspace ONE Mobile Management Tool is a modular, PowerShell-based utility built to streamline mobile device administration in enterprise environments.

Originally developed in Bash for macOS support workflows, this tool has evolved into a cross-functional PowerShell suite that empowers IT teams to:

- Query device details and installed profiles
- Reboot or wipe devices
- Push app installations
- Toggle Lost Mode
- Manage tags, DEP profiles, and more

## üîê Authentication & Security

All API calls are secured using **OAuth 2.0** (`client_credentials` grant type):

- Tokens are requested from:  
  `https://na.uemauth.vmwservices.com/connect/token`
- Cached locally at:  
  `ws1_token_cache.json`
- Automatically refreshed every hour

üîí **Host-Based Access Restriction**

- The tool is restricted to **trusted IT-managed workstations**
- All scripts depend on internal network paths like:  
  `\HOST_SERVER\MobileManagementTool\`
- `.bat` launcher is not portable and must be used from designated consoles

This prevents misuse from personal machines and secures all token usage to limited endpoints.
